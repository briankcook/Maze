#How to use MazeMaker
$Making mazes
 A maze is a rectangular grid of square cells.  Specify the number of rows and columns you would like in your maze, then press the New Maze button to make a new blank maze of that size.
$Generating and solving mazes
 To generate a maze, select a generation algorithm and click the Generate button.  Check 'Instant Generation' if you don't wish to view generation process, or want to create mazes quickly.  
 Once you are satisfied with your maze, you can apply a solving algorithm to solve it.  Select a solving algorithm and click the Solve button to begin solving. 
$Editing
 MazeMaker includes basic maze editing.  Double click any cell to set it as the finish line.  Click any two adjacent cells to toggle the wall between them.
$Playback
 You can pause, resume, stop, slow down, and speed up playback.  The 'stop' and 'clean up' buttons cancel the current action, disabling the resume function.
$Styling maze
 Mazemaker includes some styling options for displaying your maze.  The Cell Size and Walls options are purely for presentation, and can be edited to your liking.  Every maze element can also be given a color of your choice.
