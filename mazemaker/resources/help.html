 <h2>How to use MazeMaker</h2>
 <h3>Making mazes</h3>
 A maze is a rectangular grid of square cells.  Specify the 
 number of rows and columns you would like in your maze, then 
 press the New Maze button to make a new blank maze of that 
 size.
 <h3>Generating and solving mazes</h3>
 Maze generation and solving algorithms are executed by what  
 we call 'actors.'  These actors perform one action every 'n' 
 seconds, where 'n' is the specified frame delay.  
 Select a generation algorithm and click the Generate button 
 to begin generating the maze.  Uncheck 'Show generation' if 
 you don't wish to view generation process, or want to create 
 mazes quickly.  
 Once you are satisfied with your maze, you can apply a 
 solving algorithm to solve it.  Select a solving algorithm 
 and click the Solve button to begin solving. 
 <h3>Editing </h3>
 MazeMaker includes basic maze editing.  Double click any 
 cell to set it as the finish line.  Click any two adjacent 
 cells to toggle the wall between them.
 <h3>Playback </h3>
 You can pause, resume, stop, slow down, and speed up actors 
 while there is an active actor.  The 'stop' and 'clean up' 
 buttons cancel the current actor.  The 'speed up' and 'slow 
 down' buttons won't affect the initial frame delay of the 
 next actor. 
 <h3>Styling maze</h3>
 Mazemaker includes some styling options for displaying your 
 maze.  The Cell Size and Walls options are purely for 
 presentation, and can be edited to your liking.  Every maze 
 element can also be given a color of your choice.
 <h3>Recording GIFs</h3>
 If you wish to record an actor, simply press the 'record' 
 button immediately before pressing 'generate' or 'solve.' 
 When the actor finishes, or you stop the actor, your GIF 
 will be saved.  Recording will use the same frame delay 
 for every frame.  You can speed up or slow down actor 
 playback, but your GIF will play at constant speed.
